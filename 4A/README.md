### Task 5: Go High Level Deep Dive

Set up a Go High Level trial account and explore:
1. Conversational AI features
2. WhatsApp integration capabilities
3. Voice/SMS features
4. Website chat widget
5. API availability

**Deliverable:** `go-high-level-analysis.md`  
Include: feature gap analysis vs standalone bot approach, when to use GHL vs custom build, pricing breakdown

---

### Task 6: Perplexity Flow Research Log

Document your research process, not just conclusions.

**Deliverable:** `perplexity-logs/` folder  
Export your Perplexity research sessions as Markdown files. Show:
- Queries you ran
- Dead-ends you encountered
- How you arrived at conclusions

---

### Final Deliverable: Stack Recommendations

**Deliverable:** `week1-recommendations.md`  

Present **3 complete architecture stacks** combining:
- WhatsApp API provider
- Voice bot platform
- Orchestration layer
- Website integration approach

For each stack, include:
- Architecture diagram
- Monthly cost at 1K / 10K / 100K user scale
- Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- Pros/cons
- Recommended use case

---
