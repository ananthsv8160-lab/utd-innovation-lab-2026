## Semester Overarching Goal

Build a production-ready **Multi-Channel Engagement Platform** for Confer Solutions that serves:

- **JKYog** — spiritual community engagement (WhatsApp, voice, web)
- **Confer LOS** — mortgage customer communications  
- **Odyssey Nutri** — B2B/B2C health platform

By semester end, you will have researched, prototyped, and documented a unified engagement system architecture that integrates AI voice, WhatsApp, email, SMS, and web chat — with working prototypes and vendor recommendations.
